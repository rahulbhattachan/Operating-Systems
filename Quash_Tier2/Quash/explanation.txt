I was able to get everything up to tier2 testing wroking but was unable to get any of the tier 3 processes working. In quash.txt I have a quash that can run background functions but I was unable to use that code in conjuctioin with my main quash code.

I coded my quash in c++ and did everything myself I had no Partner.
